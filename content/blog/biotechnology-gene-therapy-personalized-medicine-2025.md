## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq-biotechnology}

### What is gene therapy and how does it work?
Gene therapy treats disease by introducing genetic material into a patient's cells to correct defective genes or provide new cellular functions. It uses viral vectors or other delivery methods to transport therapeutic genes to target cells, offering potential cures for previously untreatable genetic disorders.

### Is CRISPR gene editing safe for humans?
CRISPR has demonstrated excellent safety profiles in approved clinical applications, with serious adverse events occurring in less than 5% of treatments. Modern CRISPR techniques like base editing and prime editing further reduce risks by making precise changes without cutting DNA.

### How much do gene therapies cost?
Current gene therapies range from $300,000 to $2.8 million per treatment, but costs are decreasing rapidly. Many treatments provide lifelong cures, making them cost-effective compared to chronic disease management over decades.

### What diseases can be treated with gene therapy in 2025?
Approved gene therapies now treat sickle cell disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, certain cancers, inherited blindness, and various blood disorders. Clinical trials are testing treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and numerous other conditions.

### What is personalized medicine and how is it different?
Personalized medicine tailors medical treatments to individual genetic profiles, lifestyle factors, and specific disease characteristics. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all approaches, it uses genetic testing to predict drug responses and select optimal therapies for each patient.

### When will gene therapy become widely available?
Gene therapy is rapidly expanding beyond rare diseases. Treatments for common genetic conditions are expected to become widely available by 2027-2030, with preventive genetic interventions following by 2030-2035 as costs continue to decrease and technology matures.
