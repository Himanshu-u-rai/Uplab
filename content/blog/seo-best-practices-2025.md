## The Current SEO Landscape

### Key Changes in 2025
- **AI Integration**: Google's SGE (Search Generative Experience) is changing how results are displayed
- **Core Web Vitals**: Performance metrics remain crucial ranking factors
- **E-A-T Evolution**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness are more important than ever
- **Mobile-First**: Mobile optimization is no longer optional
- **User Experience**: UX signals directly impact rankings

## 1. Technical SEO Fundamentals

### Site Speed Optimization
Google's Core Web Vitals are critical ranking factors:

```html
<!-- Optimize images with proper formats and sizes -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="hero.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="hero.avif" type="image/avif">
  <img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero image" loading="lazy">
</picture>

<!-- Preload critical resources -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/css/critical.css" as="style">
```

### Core Web Vitals Targets (2025)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: ≤ 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: ≤ 100 milliseconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: ≤ 0.1

### Mobile Optimization
```css
/* Responsive design essentials */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 0 16px;
    font-size: 16px; /* Prevent zoom on iOS */
  }
  
  button {
    min-height: 44px; /* Touch target size */
    min-width: 44px;
  }
}

/* Viewport meta tag */
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5">
```
